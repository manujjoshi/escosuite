The term \"Job Order Contracting\" (JOC) refers to a technique of project delivery that is adopted by customers in order to acquire a broad range of construction demands that are often faced in a fast and easy manner. This encompasses a wide variety of restorations, repairs, and construction projects that are all under one contract. WHY CONSIDER JOB ORDER CONTRACTING? JOC has several benefits for building projects. It streamlines procurement and speeds project execution due to its flexibility. JOC reduces bidding time and cost with established unit pricing and scopes of work. JOC also encourages owner-contractor cooperation, improving project efficiency. Its versatility makes it a good choice for regular maintenance and large-scale building. Overall, Job Order Contracting may speed up project timeframes, save money, and enhance results.

Dallas Southeast Police Station had a high-performance building that needed power upgrades to increase its energy efficiency and to cut down on electricity expenses. They chose METCO to install Solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems that would share the load with the transmission grid. METCO engineers installed 304 solar panel modules on the rooftop that collectively produce 98.8 kW electricity, meeting 50% of building\u2019s energy demand. These are grid-connected AC systems with no battery or generator backup. A battery system was opted out to eliminate the need for battery charge that consumes significant energy. As a result, these PV systems are wired into the grid to power up the facility. The other 50% of power requirements that are not being met by the solar systems get fulfilled by the transmission grid. 2019 In 1876, the Kiest park was established on a mere 10 acres of land. From there, the center only continued to develop and expand. 14 decades later, the Kiest Recreation Center prides itself in providing one of the best recreational services to the residents of Dallas running a total of 32 facilities. These facilities demand a 24/7 electrical supply. One of the most cost-effective and long-lasting ways to fulfill these demands is to use renewable energy. For this, the Kiest Recreation Center partnered up with METCO to install Solar Photovoltaic systems that would overcome the power deficiency and provide supplemental energy. METCO engineering services set up a 90.1 kW Photovoltaic System that was fired up by 324 solar panels installed on site on the roof of the center. The PV system is directly linked to the transmission grid with an AC system and did not have any generator or battery for standby. This was decided to avoid the extra energy consumption required to charge the battery. The system delivered 50% of the center\u2019s backup energy while the rest was powered up by the transmission grid. METCO Engineering Inc.
