Dallas Southeast Police Station had a high-performance building that
needed power upgrades to increase its energy efficiency and to cut down
on electricity expenses. They chose METCO to install Solar Photovoltaic
(PV) systems that would share the load with the transmission grid.
METCO engineers installed 304 solar panel modules on the rooftop that
collectively produce 98.8 kW electricity, meeting 50% of building's
energy demand. These are grid-connected AC systems with no battery or
generator backup. A battery system was opted out to eliminate the need
for battery charge that consumes significant energy.
As a result, these PV systems are wired into the grid to power up the
facility. The other 50% of power requirements that are not being met by
the solar systems get fulfilled by the transmission grid.

In 1876, the Kiest park was established on a mere 10 acres of land. From
there, the center only continued to develop and expand. 14 decades later,
the Kiest Recreation Center prides itself in providing one of the best
recreational services to the residents of Dallas running a total of 32
facilities. These facilities demand a 24/7 electrical supply. One of the most
cost-effective and long-lasting ways to fulfill these demands is to use
renewable energy. For this, the Kiest Recreation Center partnered up with
METCO to install Solar Photovoltaic systems that would overcome the
power deficiency and provide supplemental energy.
METCO engineering services set up a 90.1 kW Photovoltaic System that
was fired up by 324 solar panels installed on site on the roof of the center.
The PV system is directly linked to the transmission grid with an AC
system and did not have any generator or battery for standby. This was
decided to avoid the extra energy consumption required to charge the
battery. The system delivered 50% of the center's backup energy while the
082828
rest was powered up by the transmission grid.
